## Overview
Fiturae is a dynamic web app, designed as a fitness tracker, that enables users to efficiently track their workouts. With features for creating, editing, deleting, and viewing workout details, Fiturae provides a user-friendly platform for fitness enthusiasts.

This project was developed within a month as part of a three-month full-stack bootcamp at neuefische GmbH. It showcases the full-stack development skills acquired during the bootcamp and represents a practical application of this knowledge.

As a passionate athlete and developer, the inspiration for Fiturae was to create a tool that not only meets the needs of an efficient workout tracker for oneself but also benefits other fitness enthusiasts.

### Features
Fiturae offers a range of powerful and user-friendly features, specifically designed to simplify and enhance workout tracking:

- **Create Workouts**: Users can create individual workouts with various exercises and parameters.
- **View Workouts**: All created workouts can be viewed in a clear list or display.
- **Edit Workouts**: Existing workouts can be adjusted and updated at any time to meet the changing needs of the users.
- **Delete Workouts**: Workouts that are no longer needed can be easily removed from the app.
- **View Statistics**: Users can view their personal statistics to track progress and performance development.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive, meaning it functions optimally on various devices and screen sizes.

## Process
The development of Fiturae followed a thoughtful and methodical approach, extending from conception to implementation:

- **Planning Phase**: Initially, the core functionalities of the app were defined by writing user stories. Then, wireframes were created to sketch out the user interface. These were translated into a detailed design in Figma, serving as the basis for development.

- **Development Principle**: In implementation, I adhered to the principle of "Vertical Slices". Each feature was fully implemented in both the backend and frontend before moving on to the next. Additionally, Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) were applied to ensure that only functioning code was merged into the main branch. This meant that new features went live immediately after merging. Furthermore, SonarCloud was used to continuously test code quality before changes were made to the main branch.

- **Milestones**:
    - **Version 1.0**: The first version included all planned features and ensured the core functionality of the app.
    - **Version 1.1**: This version brought significant improvements, including the integration of an OAuth2 login with GitHub and adjustments to the design for a responsive user experience on various devices.
